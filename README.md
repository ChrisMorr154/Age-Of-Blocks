# Age-Of-Blocks

Age of Blocks is a Python-based recreation of the Facebook strategy game "Age of Champions". Built with Pygame, this turn-based tactical game challenges players to command an army of blocks and a powerful "champion" unit in dynamic, automated battles. With real-time collision detection, army management, and strategic movement, the game tests your ability to outmaneuver and eliminate your opponent. Featuring a custom battle background and streamlined visuals, Age of Champions offers a nostalgic yet engaging experience for fans of strategy games and retro aesthetics. Whether you're reliving childhood memories or exploring it for the first time, this project delivers a fun and competitive challenge!

# Please Note

I am no artist and can not or will not create spites and animations for the figures. This is why it is Age of Blocks.
